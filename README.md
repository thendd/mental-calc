# What is this?

I have a college entrance exam at the end of this year (November 30th) and the candidates are not allowed to use a calculator, therefore it is relatively important to be able to make simple calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division in a small amount of time. Becuase of that, I have created this website in order to train mental calculations and strategies to make them. Other websites are full of ads or require a paid subscription (crazy, right?), so I decided to make a simple yet useful one.

# Features
- It **must** provide basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction and multiplication (division will not be included because these entrance exams allows some numbers to cancel out in a mathematical expression and this results in easier operations);
- It **must** throw errors when the user misses some calculation;
- It **should** have a minimalist yet good looking UI.

Therefore, it is an extremely basic application since I do not have enough time to add more and more features to it, even though I might do it in the future.
